# AlgebraicGeometry1
My typed notes (mainly statements and definitions) for the course Algebraic Geometry 1, followed in Padova during the AY 2019-2020.
These were mainly meant to improve my TeX capabilities (especially with respect to the usage of vim, with ultisnips and the ability to type commutative diagrams),
not to be shared as reference notes.
Only a few proofs appear in the text, usually consistig of just the most interesting/useful ideas.
